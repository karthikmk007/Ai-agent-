# Building a Static Portfolio

This guide shows you how to create a simple portfolio site for **Karthik Muthu Kumaran**, Prompt Engineering Specialist and Data Analyst (AI/ML) at **SteamrollEast LLC** (Buffalo, Wyoming, US). The instructions use Visual Studio Code and show how to deploy the site for free on GitHub Pages.

## 1. Project Structure

Create the following folder layout:

```
portfolio/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   └── styles.css
└── js/
    └── script.js
```

- `index.html` — main webpage
- `css/styles.css` — custom styles
- `js/script.js` — optional JavaScript

## 2. Setting Up in Visual Studio Code

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Clone this repository or create a new local folder and open it in VS Code.
3. Inside the workspace, create the folders and files shown above. You can start from the templates provided in `portfolio/`.
4. Use the **Live Server** extension in VS Code to preview the website locally. Right-click `index.html` and choose **Open with Live Server**.

## 3. Customizing the Portfolio

Edit `index.html` to update project descriptions and contact information. Modify `css/styles.css` for colors and layout. You can add more pages or scripts under the same folder structure if needed.

## 4. Free Deployment with GitHub Pages

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository (create one if needed).
2. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Select the branch (usually `main`) and root folder (`/portfolio` if using this repo) for the site source.
4. Save. After a few minutes, your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/`.

For more customization, you can also deploy using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which offers a simple drag-and-drop interface or direct Git integration.
