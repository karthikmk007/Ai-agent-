# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

Hello! I'm a software developer who enjoys building fullstack applications. This repository contains a sample project demonstrating a React front‑end with a FastAPI back‑end.

## Overview
- **Backend**: FastAPI service with MongoDB integration
- **Frontend**: React application styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Tests**: Automated API tests using `requests` and `unittest`

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for your own projects.

## Getting Started
1. Install the backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && yarn install
   ```
3. Run the development servers (backend and frontend) to see the app in action.
